## Project description

This program lets the user play a solo game of hangman from a dictionary file. The game has three levels of difficulty the user can select from.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile and run the project.

```bash
g++ -o hangman.exe hangman.cpp
./hangman.exe
```

## UI Design

When the program is run, the user will see a select difficulty screen with 3 options (Fig 1.). After the User selects the difficulty, the game of hangman will be generated and the user will be prompted to make a guess (Fig 2.). Once the user has made their guess, the program will interpret their guess and show them whether they were correct or incorrect (Fig 3.). After the user has either run out of guesses or solved the phrase, the program will notify them on whether they won or lost (Fig 4.).
